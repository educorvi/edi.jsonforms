# How a form is rendered
- The form is rendered with form_view.pt and form_view.py (it is called form-view)
- To work, it needs json_schema_view.py to provide the json schema
                and ui_schema_view.py to provide the ui schema
  - they are called json-schema-view and ui-schema-view (with @@...-view in the template)
- ui_schema_view.py works with showOn_properties.py to generate the rita-rules

# How a form with tooltips is rendered
- template: form_tools_view.pt
- the json schema is generated by the usual logic (json_schema_view.py)
- the ui schema is generated by UiSchemaToolsView (in ui_schema_tools_view.py, extends UiSchemaView)

# How a single field is rendered
- If a single field is displayed, the form_element_view.pt is used (it is called form-element-view)
- the small ui and json schema only for the field are generated by
  - FormElementUiSchema (extends the UiSchemaView, but all dependencies are ignored)
  - and FormElementJsonSchema (extends the JsonSchemaView)
  - both classes are located in form_element_view.py

# How a Wizard View of multiple forms is rendered
- template: wizard_view.pt
- json schema and ui schema of the different forms are combined into one json and ui schema each
- json schema:
  - created by WizardJsonSchemaView (in wizard_view.py, extends JsonSchemaView)
  - handles each form as an complex object
- ui schema:
  - created by WizardUiSchemaView (in wizard_view.py, extends UiSchemaView)
  - handles the each form as a 'VerticalLayout' type
