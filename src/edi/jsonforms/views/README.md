# How a form is rendered
- The form is rendered with form_view.pt and form_view.py (it is called form-view)
- To work, it needs json_schema_view.py to provide the json schema
                and ui_schema_view.py to provide the ui schema
  - they are called json-schema-view and ui-schema-view (with @...-view in the template)
- ui_schema_view.py works with showOn_properties.py to generate the rita-rules

# How a single field with tooltips is rendered
- If a single field is displayed, the form_element_view.pt is used (it is called form-element-view)
- the small ui schema only for the field is generated by form_element_ui_schema.py (all dependencies are ignored)
  - it extends the UiSchemaView
  - it is called form-element-ui-schema
- the small json schema only for the field is generated by form_element_json_schema.py
  - it extends the JsonSchemaView
  - it is called form-element-json-schema
