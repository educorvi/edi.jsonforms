msgid "A Complex is used to group fields together that are connected. Unlike normal fieldsets, a complex doesn't only group to enhance clarity and structure but to encapsulate related data or concepts. A Complex (including all contained fields, fieldsets, arrays, ...) can be dependent from the option of another field but a normal fieldset not."
